# Archive public Facebook comments

By default this only archives comments on my posts, but it should be easy to
play with if you want to use this for your own posts.

## Usage

1. Visit chrome://extensions

2. Enable Developer Mode

3. Click the "Load unpacked" and select the extension directory

4. Click "Details" on the extension card

5. Enable "Allow in Incognito"

6. Edit comments.js and comments-outer.js to replace the extension ID with the
   ID on your system.

7. Open Incognito and visit https://www.facebook.com/jefftk/posts/819765171902
   or something. It should create a file in the Downloads folder named
   819765171902.json with the comments.

8. archive.py is what I use next to clean it and copy to my server.
