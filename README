# Archive public Facebook comments

By default this only archives comments on my posts, but it should be easy to
play with if you want to use this for your own posts.

If you get an error like "Chrome version must be between 70 and 73" you need to
upgrade chromedriver.  Chrome updates automatically but Chromedriver doesn't.
I use:

    brew cask upgrade chromedriver

## Usage

Since FB compresses their IDs and sometimes changes them, and also tweaks their
pages, you should expect to need to edit the script each time you use it.

Open a private browsing window (so you don't scrape anything that should only
be accessible to you as a logged in user), load a page with comments, and try
pasting comments.js into the console.  If everything is working:

1. The comments should all be expanded.

2. The login overlay should be dismissed.

3. window.COLLECTED_COMMENTS will have the comments.

Then try running comment.py by itself.  Ex:

    python3 comment.py tmp 819765171902

If that works, it should be all set.
